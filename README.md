# Welcome to Spill

## What is Spill?


Spill is a website where users share information about environmental issues. Users
can report a new issue, check up on old ones, or find issues specific to an area, whether close to them or far
away. Whether youâ€™re a corporate whistleblower, concerned parent, or local official, Spill is the place for your
environmental concern.


Spill is made by a team of six students from San Francisco State University studying computer science, as part
of Computer Science 648: Software Engineering under Dragutin Petkovic and Anthony Souza. Visit spill at
